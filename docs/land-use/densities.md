# Settlement Densities

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of settlement density
- Identify factors influencing settlement density
- Recognize the implications of different density levels on urban planning and quality of life

## Concept Explanation
Settlement density refers to the number of people, dwellings, or structures per unit area (usually per square kilometer or mile). Key points include:

- Types of density measurements:
  - Population density
  - Residential density
  - Employment density

- Factors influencing density:
  - Land availability and cost
  - Cultural preferences
  - Economic factors
  - Transportation systems
  - Building technology
  - Planning policies

- Implications of density:
  - High density: Efficient use of land and infrastructure, but potential for overcrowding
  - Low density: More space per person, but potentially inefficient use of resources

## Real-World Examples
1. Mumbai, India: Very high-density urban areas (slums and high-rise apartments)
2. Phoenix, Arizona: Low-density suburban sprawl
3. Barcelona, Spain: Medium to high-density urban design with mixed-use development

## Poll Question
Which of the following is NOT typically associated with high-density urban areas?

A) Efficient public transportation  
B) Higher land costs  
C) Lower per capita energy consumption  
D) Increased dependence on personal vehicles  

(Correct answer: D)
