# Settlement Hierarchy

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of settlement hierarchy
- Identify the levels within a typical settlement hierarchy
- Recognize the relationship between settlement size, function, and position in the hierarchy

## Concept Explanation
Settlement hierarchy is a way of arranging settlements in a hierarchy based on their population size and the range of services they provide. A typical hierarchy includes:

1. Hamlet: Smallest settlement, few services
2. Village: Basic services like a primary school and small shops
3. Town: More diverse services, secondary schools, small hospitals
4. City: Wide range of services, specialized shops, universities, large hospitals
5. Metropolis: Extensive and specialized services, major cultural and economic center
6. Megalopolis: A chain of roughly adjacent metropolitan areas

As you move up the hierarchy, settlements generally have:
- Larger populations
- More and higher-order services
- Greater sphere of influence
- More diverse economic activities

## Real-World Examples
1. London: Top of the UK settlement hierarchy
2. Manchester: Large city, below London in the hierarchy
3. Ely: Small city/large town in Cambridgeshire, UK
4. Grantchester: Village near Cambridge, UK
