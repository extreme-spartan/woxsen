Key points include: Larger settlements generally have larger spheres of influence The sphere of influence varies for different services (e.g., a hospital serves a larger area than a corner shop) Factors affecting sphere of influence include: Size and importance of the settlement Range and quality of services offered Accessibility and transport links Competition from other settlements Real-World Examples New York City: Global sphere of influence for financial services Paris: Continental sphere of influence for fashion and culture Regional shopping center: Serves surrounding towns and villages Local grocery store: Serves immediate neighborhood Poll Question Which factor is least likely to directly increase a settlement's sphere of influence?
